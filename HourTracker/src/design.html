<h1>Hourtracker design</h1>

<ol>
<li>See how much we deviate from the 8 hours per day schedule, for any month.</li>
<li>Create a new task</li>
<li>Activate a task</li>
<li>Correct wrong hours</li>
<li>Round to quarters of an hour per day/ per week</li>
<li>Show worked intervals per task</li>
</ol>

<h2>Activating a task</h2>
When a task in the list is double clicked it is activated.
The title of the main view changes to the name of the task 
so the user can see in the task bar which task is currently active.

<h2>How to store timestamps?</h2>
We have to be able to easily calculate time between two timestamps.
We have to be able to (convert it to) see the date and clock hour and minute (maybe even second), e.g. Sep 12, 2008 14:53:16.

Do we really need the day notion? 
If we just encode the time in the day, and be able to calculate the elapsed time between two of those times wouldn't that be enough?
How would we get totals for a week? 
You could just select the set of days you want totalized, without the program understanding the week concept.

We could make a very simple date class that can have 1-31 as day, 1-12 as month and any number as year.
It would be possible to create non-existent dates, but it also allows for grouping by month and year.
Grouping by week is not really needed.

Avoid the heavy, complex feeling Date and Calendar classes.
